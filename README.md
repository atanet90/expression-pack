> A collection of chinese memes / reaction images (Biao Qing [表情])

## Access this as an "API"

Query /meta on the GitHub pages hosted instance to get the number of images. You can now request all the images from the /img endpoint, they are all .jpg files and start at 0.

## Todo

- A more interactive API with more information about images (this will require recrating/-scraping most data however)
- Scrape pngs and convert them to jpg

## Data source

Up to id 127 (at current times) all images are collected by hand from tons of different sites, mostly by using baidu with different search terms. Most of the images however were scraped from fabiaoqing.com using the script in this repository.
